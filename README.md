# gmail-bash

This is a simple selenium Chromium/Chrome tool to check your gmail STRAIGHT from the bash Command Line!
Firstly, this is mainly for my own usage, but feel free to use it for yourself. 
There may be a few errors!! I tried to make it as global as possible but I am happy to help in the issues section.

    Usage: $ ./gmail --email/-E   your-email@gmail.com   --password/-P   yourpassword123   --read-all-email/-R [OPTIONAL]   --incognito/-I [OPTIONAL]
