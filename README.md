# gmail-bash

This is a simple selenium Chromium/Chrome tool to check your gmail STRAIGHT from the bash Command Line.
This was mainly for my own usage, but feel free to use it for yourself. 
There may be a few errors!! I tried to make it as global as possible but I am happy to help in the issues section.
This program required selenium which can be installed with `pip install selenium`.

    Usage: $ ./gmail --email/-E   your-email@gmail.com   --password/-P   yourpassword123   --read-all-email/-R [OPTIONAL]   --incognito/-I [OPTIONAL]
